1. Introduction
===============

UPPAAL CORA is free for non-profit applications but we want all users
to fill in a license agreement. This can be done online on the web
site http://www.uppaal.com/ or by sending in the form attached below.

This product includes the libxml2 library which is copyrighted as
follows: "Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Daniel Veillard.  All Rights
Reserved."

2. Installation
===============

To install, unzip the zip-file. This should create the directory
containing at least the files uppaal, uppaal2k.jar, and the
directories lib, bin-Linux and bin-Win32. The bin-directories should
all contain the two files verifyta(.exe) and server(.exe) plus some
additional files, depending on the platform.

Note that UPPAAL will not run without Java installed on the host
system. Java for SunOS, Windows95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP, and Linux can be
downloaded from http://java.sun.com.

The present version of UPPAAL does no longer support versions 1.1,
1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). You need at
least JRE 5, and we strongly recommend using the most recent version
available for your platform.

To run UPPAAL on Linux execute the script named 'uppaal'. To run on
Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP systems double click the file
uppaal2k.jar.

The text of the agreement follows:
                                              
We (the licensee) understand that UPPAAL includes the programs:
uppaal2k.jar, uppaal, server, socketserver, and verifyta and that they
are supplied "as is", without expressed or implied warranty. We agree
on the following:

1. You (the licensers) do not have any obligation to provide any
   maintenance or consulting help with respect to UPPAAL. 

2. You neither have any responsibility for the correctness of systems
   verified using UPPAAL, nor for the correctness of UPPAAL itself.

3. We will never distribute or modify any part of the UPPAAL code
   (i.e. the source code and the object code) without a written
   permission of Gerd Behrmann (Aalborg University), Kim Larsen
   (Aalborg University), Paul Petterson (Uppsala University) or Wang
   Yi (Uppsala University).
   
4. We will only use UPPAAL for non-profit research purposes. This
   implies that neither UPPAAL nor any part of its code should be used
   or modified for any commercial software product.

In the event that you should release new versions of UPPAAL to us, we
agree that they will also fall under all of these terms.
